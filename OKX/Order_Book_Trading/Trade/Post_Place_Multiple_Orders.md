### POST / Place multiple orders

Place orders in batches. Maximum 20 orders can be placed per request.  
Request parameters should be passed in the form of an array. Orders will be placed in turn

**Rate Limit:** 300 orders per 2 seconds  
**Rate limit rule:** User ID + Instrument ID  
**Permission:** Trade

ðŸ’¡ Unlike other endpoints, the rate limit of this endpoint is determined by the number of orders. If there is only one order in the request, it will consume the rate limit of `Place order`.
