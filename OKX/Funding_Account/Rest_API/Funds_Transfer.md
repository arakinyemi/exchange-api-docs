### Funds transfer
Only API keys with Trade privilege can call this endpoint.

This endpoint supports the transfer of funds between your funding account and trading account, and from the master account to sub-accounts.

Sub-account can transfer out to master account by default. Need to call Set permission of transfer out to grant privilege first if you want sub-account transferring to another sub-account (sub-accounts need to belong to same master account.)

**Note:** The success or failure of the request does not necessarily reflect the actual transfer result. Recommend checking the transfer status by calling "Get funds transfer state" to confirm the final result.

**Rate Limit:** 2 requests per second  
**Rate limit rule:** User ID + Currency
