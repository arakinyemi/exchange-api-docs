Response fields:

|Name|	Type	|Mandatory	|Description|

### Status codes​

Status codes in the `status` field are the same as in HTTP.

Here are some common status codes that you might encounter:

* `200` indicates a successful response.
* `4XX` status codes indicate invalid requests; the issue is on your side.
  * `400` – your request failed, see `error` for the reason.
  * `403` – you have been blocked by the Web Application Firewall.
  * `409` – your request partially failed but also partially succeeded, see `error` for details.
  * `418` – you have been auto-banned for repeated violation of rate limits.
  * `429` – you have exceeded API request rate limit, please slow down.
* `5XX` status codes indicate internal errors; the issue is on Binance's side.
  * **Important:** If a response contains 5xx status code, it **does not** necessarily mean that your request has failed.
    Execution status is *unknown* and the request might have actually succeeded.
    Please use query methods to confirm the status.
    You might also want to establish a new WebSocket connection for that.

See Error codes for Binance for a list of error codes and messages.
