### General Info on Limits​

* The following `intervalLetter` values for headers:
  * SECOND => S
  * MINUTE => M
  * HOUR => H
  * DAY => D
* `intervalNum` describes the amount of the interval. For example, `intervalNum` 5 with `intervalLetter` M means "Every 5 minutes".
* The `/api/v3/exchangeInfo` `rateLimits` array contains objects related to the exchange's `RAW_REQUESTS`, `REQUEST_WEIGHT`, and `ORDERS` rate limits. These are further defined in the `ENUM definitions` section under `Rate limiters (rateLimitType)`.
* Requests fail with HTTP status code 429 when you exceed the request rate limit.

### IP Limits​

* Every request will contain `X-MBX-USED-WEIGHT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter)` in the response headers which has the current used weight for the IP for all request rate limiters defined.
* Each route has a `weight` which determines for the number of requests each endpoint counts for. Heavier endpoints and endpoints that do operations on multiple symbols will have a heavier `weight`.
* When a 429 is received, it's your obligation as an API to back off and not spam the API.
* **Repeatedly violating rate limits and/or failing to back off after receiving 429s will result in an automated IP ban (HTTP status 418).**
* IP bans are tracked and **scale in duration** for repeat offenders, **from 2 minutes to 3 days**.
* A `Retry-After` header is sent with a 418 or 429 responses and will give the **number of seconds** required to wait, in the case of a 429, to prevent a ban, or, in the case of a 418, until the ban is over.
* **The limits on the API are based on the IPs, not the API keys.**

### Unfilled Order Count​

* Every successful order response will contain a `X-MBX-ORDER-COUNT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter)` header indicating how many orders you have placed for that interval.   
    
 
* Rejected/unsuccessful orders are not guaranteed to have `X-MBX-ORDER-COUNT-**` headers in the response.
* If you have exceeded this, you will receive a 429 error without the `Retry-After` header.
* **Please note that if your orders are consistently filled by trades, you can continuously place orders on the API**. For more information, please see Spot Unfilled Order Count Rules.
* **The number of unfilled orders is tracked for each account.**
