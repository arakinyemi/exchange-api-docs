```
DELETE /api/v3/order
```

Cancel an active order.

**Weight:**
1

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| symbol | STRING | YES |  |
| orderId | LONG | NO |  |
| origClientOrderId | STRING | NO |  |
| newClientOrderId | STRING | NO | Used to uniquely identify this cancel. Automatically generated by default. |
| cancelRestrictions | ENUM | NO | Supported values:  `ONLY_NEW` - Cancel will succeed if the order status is `NEW`.  `ONLY_PARTIALLY_FILLED`  - Cancel will succeed if order status is `PARTIALLY_FILLED`. |
| recvWindow | LONG | NO | The value cannot be greater than `60000`. |
| timestamp | LONG | YES |  |

Notes:

* Either `orderId` or `origClientOrderId` must be sent.
* If both `orderId` and `origClientOrderId` are provided, the `orderId` is searched first, then the `origClientOrderId` from that result is checked against that order. If both conditions are not met the request will be rejected.

**Data Source:**
Matching Engine

**Response:**

```json
{  
  "symbol": "LTCBTC",  
  "origClientOrderId": "myOrder1",  
  "orderId": 4,  
  "orderListId": -1, // Unless it's part of an order list, value will be -1  
  "clientOrderId": "cancelMyOrder1",  
  "transactTime": 1684804350068,  
  "price": "2.00000000",  
  "origQty": "1.00000000",  
  "executedQty": "0.00000000",  
  "origQuoteOrderQty": "0.000000",  
  "cummulativeQuoteQty": "0.00000000",  
  "status": "CANCELED",  
  "timeInForce": "GTC",  
  "type": "LIMIT",  
  "side": "BUY",  
  "selfTradePreventionMode": "NONE"  
}
```

**Notes:**

* The payload above does not show all fields that can appear in the order response. Please refer to Conditional fields in Order Responses.
* The performance for canceling an order (single cancel or as part of a cancel-replace) is always better when only `orderId` is sent. Sending `origClientOrderId` or both `orderId` + `origClientOrderId` will be slower.

**Regarding `cancelRestrictions`**

* If the `cancelRestrictions` value is not any of the supported values, the error will be:

```json
{  
    "code": -1145,  
    "msg": "Invalid cancelRestrictions"  
}
```

* If the order did not pass the conditions for `cancelRestrictions`, the error will be:

```json
{  
    "code": -2011,  
    "msg": "Order was not canceled due to cancel restrictions."  
}
```
